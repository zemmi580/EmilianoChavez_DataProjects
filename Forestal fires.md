Here I am going to make a infrom about the forest fires in Mexico throw the years, also I will present the Information that I find 
In this project I used R, Tableau and Excel.
Where I got the most part of the data, was from(A goverment web page): http://dgeiawf.semarnat.gob.mx:8080/approot/dgeia_mce/html/mce_index.html 
Let's start!
How I started this project was with the idea of seeing how many forestal fires had happened in Mexico, because I have heard that there where too much on going fires in the mexican territory.
With that idea on mind, I started looking for the data I needed.
What i found in this data "http://dgeiawf.semarnat.gob.mx:8080/ibi_apps/WFServlet?IBIF_ex=D3_RFORESTA05_01&IBIC_user=dgeia_mce&IBIC_pass=dgeia_mce&NOMBREENTIDAD=*&NOMBREANIO=*"
I used data from 1991 to 2023 (I did this in 2024)
First, I wanted to see if the forestal fires are due to the high temperatures that Mexico having. So I did a map (using tableau) for the years 1991 and 2023 to see if I could find any tendency or a relation between them.

This are the total number of forestal fires around Mexico

Unless you are a keen observer, is hard to see a tendency, but if you look closely you can see that the forestal fires haven't really increase that much in all estates. Let's then clear things up a little bit more.
Here is the comparation between 1991 and 2023:

As you can see the number of forestal fires has decrease, and if we see the total number of fires through the years:
